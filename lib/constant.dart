Bhutanese authorities employed innovative strategies such as using a health surveillance system linked with citizen ID cards to monitor and contain the virus's spread effectively. Moreover, the country's strong sense of community and cultural values played a crucial role in promoting adherence to health protocols and supporting those in need during lockdowns. As vaccination became available, Bhutan prioritized equitable distribution, ensuring even remote communities received doses. This holistic approach has not only minimized the impact of COVID-19 on public health but also strengthened resilience and unity among its citizens.";
